
IRIS CLASS CLASSIFICATION

# A machine learning project using Python. 
# This project is a supervised learning, classification problem with multiple classes.
# In this project, we will compare and contrast the performance of three different learning models on a common and publicly available dataset.
# We will be using the iris flowers dataset, which contains 150 observations of iris flowers.
# There are four columns of measurements and the species of flower observed.
# Only three species are present in this dataset.

# Model Used:
  Logistic Regression
  RandomForest

# Accuracy of 95.55% in both case.
